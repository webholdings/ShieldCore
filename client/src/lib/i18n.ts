      day2_science_title: "Die Kraft der Komprimierung",
      day2_science: "Paradoxerweise verursacht zu viel Zeit im Bett Schlaflosigkeit. Indem wir Ihre Zeit im Bett an Ihre tatsächliche Schlafzeit anpassen, erhöhen wir den 'Schlafdruck', was das Einschlafen erleichtert.",

      day4_science: "Physiologische Erregung (hohe Herzfrequenz, Muskelspannung) verhindert das Einschlafen. Aktive Entspannungstechniken können diesen Erregungszustand manuell senken.",
      day5_science_title: "Über den Schlaf nachdenken",
      day5_science: "Gedanken wie 'Wenn ich nicht schlafe, scheitere ich morgen' erzeugen Leistungsangst, die den Schlaf zerstört. Wir nutzen KVT, um diese katastrophierenden Gedanken umzuformulieren.",
